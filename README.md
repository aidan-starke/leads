# Todo list Kata

This is a kata to practice everything you've learned in the first five weeks of bootcamp.

## Your mission is

Build a todo list where a user can view / add / edit / delete todo items using react and a local api.

## Recommended strategy

1. Tackle the project using vertical slices that are fully functional
  1. User can view a list of tasks from the database
  2. User can add a task
  3. User can edit a task
  4. User can delete a task
  5. User can complete a task
  6. User can view all completed tasks
 
2. Code from the outside in
  1. Start by building the html of a components render method
  2. Add event handlers for any interactive elements
  3. Build the client side api code
  4. Create the server side api code
  5. Create your database migrations / seeds 
  6. Create your knex code
  
3. Test each step as you build it
